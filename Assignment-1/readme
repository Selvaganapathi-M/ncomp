I have developed this applicatin for monitoring USB devices connected and removed from the system.
This is GTK based application so system need GTK3 depend libs.And Mainly developed for ubuntu platform. 
Also need libusb and libudev lib for getting PID,VID,MANUFACTURER,PRODUCT.

Compile and run the application by below prcedure.

gtk cpp build
$g++ usbmon.c -o usbmon `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` -ludev

Run usbmonitor
$./usbmon
